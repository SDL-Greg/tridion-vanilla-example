# Overview

This is some very basic code to illustrate how content can easily be retrieved from SDL Tridion simply by using JavaScript fetch() calls.

This code won't work without a working version of Tridion.  Please contact me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregoryguttmann/ and I'd be happy to set you up with a demo.
